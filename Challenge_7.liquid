<!-- Challenge 7 -->
  
<!-- 
Unlike with collections, we can't just loop over all the products in a store.

Even though there is one global object that's called "all_products", 

it only helps to access individual products based on their handle. 
â†’ all_products["sunglasses-xyz"] for instance.


Every store has a hidden collection called "all". As the name suggests, this collection also contains a list of all products. 

You can access the collection object in the following way:

 { { collections["all"] }}

-->
  

<!-- 
a.)  Create an <ul> element with a css class of "product-list", that holds all the existing product titles as individual list items. 

Within the list items, wrap the title into a h4-element

-->
<!--    -->
<!-- Renders all the hidden products in the collections -->

<ul class="product-list">
  {% for product in collections["all"].products  %}
  <li>
    <h4>{{product.title}}</h4>
  </li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>

<!--
b.) Before putting out a product title check the availability of the product.

If it's unavailable, don't show it.

(you can test this by editing one of the products -> check the checkbox to track the quantity -> set the quantity to 0 -> this product is now unavailable)
-->


  
<!--
c.) Display the product image (featured image / first image) above the title, but still within the list items.

The images should be rendered with a 200px width.

Hint: You will need to use an image url filter.

--> 

  

  
  
 
<!--
d.) Add a button to view the product page below the title.

You can use an a-tag with the css class "btn" as button.

-->
  

  
  
  
<!--
e.) Add a second button, to immediatley add the product to the cart.

Hint:
The easiest way of adding a product to the cart is by clicking a link that points to:
/cart/add?id=1234

Hereby the ID referes to the corresponding variant ID.
It's important to note that the variant-ID is different from the overall product-ID.

Let me explain:
Every product has at least one variant. 
Even if we don't have further colors or size-options to choose from.

In that case, the hidden variant represents the product itself, but the variant-ID is still different form the product-ID.

You may want to take a look at the product object and a property called "first_available_variant".
